# SCOREGRADE
BASIC PROGRAM TO FIND THE GRADE OF A PARTICULAR SUBJECT WHEN THE MARK IS ENTERED
Here’s what it does  -
for marks,
85 - 100 -> Grade A 
70 - 84 -> Grade B 
55 - 69 -> Grade C 
40 - 54 -> Grade D 
Below 40 -> Grade F
So, the program first asks the user for the marks. Maybe take an input after printing “Enter the mark: “ or something similar. 
Then use decision making and print “Grade A”, “Grade B”, “Grade C”, “Grade D”, “Grade E” or “Grade F” based on the bins provided above.
